### Mercury Engine
Mercury 3D game engine made in LWJGL framework with OpenGL and GLFW.

### Using this engine
Currently the engine is in a very basic state and isn't very useful for creating games. <br>
However the engine will be worked on and more managers and entity components will be implemented.
